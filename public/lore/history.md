- **2193**: The first humans are drafted by the galactic military. The draft is limited to manpower as humans are still lacking relevant technology.
- **2195**: The draft into the Galactic military creates tension on Earth, as many see it as a sign of deeper subjugation. However, it also provides an opportunity for humans to gain combat experience and access to advanced military technology.

### Early 23rd Century - Current Era

Humanity is now an established but still minor player in the Galactic Empire. 
The struggle for technological parity continues, as does the exploration of new frontiers.
By the early 23rd century, the population growth has stabilized with around 16 billion humans inhabiting the planet.
The increase in population density was balanced by the technological advances that joining the Empire has brought.
Earth's cities are sprawling, vertical metropolises where towering skyscrapers and subterranean levels create a layered, interconnected environment.
With the advances in technology humanity was also finally able to put a stop to the climate change and at least stabilize the planet.
Besides the technological advances and unification of humanity, joining the empire had little influence on the life of the average citizen.
Life on earth continues, ignorant of the conflicts broiling in the wider galaxy.

### New Factions

- **United Earth Government**: The UEG is the central governing body, formed after the unification of Earth's nations in response to the pressures of galactic integration.
  It coordinates global policies, space exploration, and relations with the Galactic Empire.
  Despite its central authority, the UEG is often seen as a bureaucratic entity struggling to balance the diverse interests of Earth's regions.
  The UEG promotes a globalist culture, emphasizing unity, technological advancement, and Earth's place within the galaxy.
  The economy is highly diverse, with major industries including space technology, biotech, and cybernetics.
  Corporate power is significant, with mega-corporations often wielding as much influence as the government itself.
- **The Consortium**: A powerful alliance of mega-corporations that wield significant influence over Earth's economy and politics. 
  The Consortium often operates in the shadows, advancing its own interests through manipulation, trade, and covert operations.
- **The Terran Resistance**: A loosely organized group of dissidents and freedom fighters who seek to liberate humanity from the Empire's control. 
  They operate in secret, as any acts against the empire that can be traced back to humanity could lead to extermination by the galactics.
  This limits the resistance to intelligence gathering and only small acts of defiance against the empire.

### E1 (Earth One) Organization
E1, or "Earth One," is a clandestine organization dedicated to advancing humanity's standing within the Galactic Empire. 
Operating in the shadows, E1 believes that Earth's future lies in becoming a powerful and independent force, capable of negotiating on equal terms with other species. 
To achieve this goal, E1 employs a network of freelance agents who carry out covert operations, often skirting—or outright breaking—the law.

- **Mission**: E1's primary objective is to strengthen humanity's position within the Galactic Empire by any means necessary. 
  This includes acquiring advanced alien technologies, influencing political decisions, conducting espionage, and even eliminating threats to Earth's sovereignty. 
  E1 is driven by the belief that humanity must be prepared to defend itself and assert its interests in an increasingly hostile galaxy.
- **Methods**: E1 operates with extreme secrecy, using compartmentalized cells and freelance operatives to maintain deniability. 
  These agents are often recruited from the ranks of disgruntled military personnel, skilled mercenaries, rogue scientists, and individuals with unique talents. 
  Missions are varied and may involve sabotage, smuggling, theft, assassination, or the retrieval of sensitive information. 
  While E1's actions are sometimes morally ambiguous, its leaders are unwavering in their commitment to the greater good of humanity.
  E1 currently finds itself mainly in rivalry with other lower vassals of the empire, as acts against the empire itself could lead to humanities extermination.
- **Structure**: E1 is organized into small, independent cells, each with its own mission focus and operational autonomy. 
  The identities of E1's leadership remain unknown, even to many within the organization, adding an extra layer of security. 
  Communication is handled through encrypted channels and anonymous contacts, ensuring that no single agent or cell knows the full extent of E1's operations.
- **Ethics**: While E1's methods are often controversial, the organization views them as necessary evils in the pursuit of a greater good. 
  E1 operatives are expected to prioritize the mission above personal morality, understanding that their actions are part of a larger struggle for humanity's survival and autonomy. 
  In the complex and dangerous world of galactic politics, E1 is a shadowy force working tirelessly to ensure that Earth remains more than just a minor vassal state, striving to secure a future where humanity is strong, respected, and self-reliant.
