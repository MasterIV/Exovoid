### Early 22nd Century - First Contact
Humanity’s expansion into the outer solar system attracted the attention of the Galactic Empire. 
The Empire’s arrival presented humanity with an ultimatum: 
integrate or be annihilated. Choosing integration, 
humanity became a minor vassal state within the Empire.

**Key Events:**
- **2111**: Humanity establishes a research outpost on Europa.
- **2114**: First contact with the Galactic Empire.
- **2115**: The Galactic Empire's arrival in the solar system is not entirely peaceful. Initial encounters involve skirmishes with automated defense systems and probes, leading to tense negotiations before the ultimatum is presented.
- **2020**: The Empire begins a cultural exchange program, allowing select humans to study on imperial worlds. This program introduces humanity to advanced scientific principles, alien languages, and the complex political structure of the Empire.
- **2124**: Earth formally becomes a vassal state of the Galactic Empire.
- **2127**: With Imperial assistance, humanity accelerates the terraforming of Mars, making it more Earth-like within its biospheres and significantly boosting its population and strategic importance.

### Mid 22nd Century - Struggles and Adaptation
As part of the Galactic Empire, humanity faced significant challenges. 
The gap in technology and economic power was vast, 
and humans had to adapt quickly to survive and thrive in this new interstellar environment.

**Key Events:**
- **2132**: Humanity starts trading unique goods and services to obtain advanced technology.
- **2135**: The Galactic Empire imposes harsh trade restrictions, leading to a period of economic exploitation. Human industries are forced to produce specific goods for the Empire, stifling Earth's economy and creating unrest.
- **2140**: Human acquire their first vessel with an FTL drive allowing them to travel to other systems.
- **2145**: Small but determined resistance movements begin to form within human colonies, aiming to gain more autonomy from the Empire. These movements are initially disorganized but gradually gain support from disaffected citizens.
- **2150**: Exposure to various alien species and cultures leads to a cultural renaissance on Earth and its colonies. Art, literature, and philosophy flourish, often blending human and alien elements.
- **2151**: The first embassy is established on a foreign space station of the Xelari.

### Late 22nd Century - Galactic Expansion
With the ability to travel faster than light, 
humans began exploring beyond the solar system. 
New colonies were established on distant planets, 
and humanity started to carve out a niche within the Galactic Empire.

**Key Events:**
- **2169**: Establishment of the first human colony outside the solar system.
- **2182**: Humans discover and start exploring Elder ruins. However, these ruins are mostly of historical value.
- **2185**: Human scientists make significant strides in xenobiology, allowing for the development of new medicines and biotechnologies derived from alien organisms. These advancements improve human health and extend lifespans, further integrating humans into the Empire.
- **2193**: The first humans are drafted by the galactic military. The draft is limited to manpower as humans are still lacking relevant technology.
- **2195**: The draft into the Galactic military creates tension on Earth, as many see it as a sign of deeper subjugation. However, it also provides an opportunity for humans to gain combat experience and access to advanced military technology.

### Early 23rd Century - Current Era
Humanity is now an established but still minor player in the Galactic Empire. 
The struggle for technological parity continues, 
as does the exploration of new frontiers and the ongoing cold war with the Hegemony. 
The search for Elder artifacts remains a critical focus, 
as they hold the key to potentially elevating humanity’s status in the galaxy.

**Key Events:**
- **2200**: Human scientists comprehend the basics of jump drives establishing a base for humanity's star ship industry.
- **2208**: Mega-corporations, bolstered by their control of new technologies and resources, begin to rival Earth's governments in influence. These corporations often operate independently, with their own agendas that may not align with humanity's best interests.
- **2209**: The first completely human-built vessel conducts its first FTL flight.
- **2210**: The cold war with the Hegemony intensifies, with espionage, proxy conflicts, and covert operations becoming more common. Humans play a key role in these operations, often acting as intermediaries or mercenaries.

### New Factions
- **The Consortium**: A powerful alliance of mega-corporations that wield significant influence over Earth's economy and politics. The Consortium often operates in the shadows, advancing its own interests through manipulation, trade, and covert operations.
- **The Terran Resistance**: A loosely organized group of dissidents and freedom fighters who seek to liberate humanity from the Empire's control. They operate in secret, sabotaging imperial facilities and spreading anti-Empire propaganda.

### E1 (Earth One) Organization
E1, or "Earth One," is a clandestine organization dedicated to advancing humanity's standing within the Galactic Empire. Operating in the shadows, E1 believes that Earth's future lies in becoming a powerful and independent force, capable of negotiating on equal terms with other species. To achieve this goal, E1 employs a network of freelance agents who carry out covert operations, often skirting—or outright breaking—the law.

- **Mission**: E1's primary objective is to strengthen humanity's position within the Galactic Empire by any means necessary. This includes acquiring advanced alien technologies, influencing political decisions, conducting espionage, and even eliminating threats to Earth's sovereignty. E1 is driven by the belief that humanity must be prepared to defend itself and assert its interests in an increasingly hostile galaxy.
- **Methods**: E1 operates with extreme secrecy, using compartmentalized cells and freelance operatives to maintain deniability. These agents are often recruited from the ranks of disgruntled military personnel, skilled mercenaries, rogue scientists, and individuals with unique talents. Missions are varied and may involve sabotage, smuggling, theft, assassination, or the retrieval of sensitive information. While E1's actions are sometimes morally ambiguous, its leaders are unwavering in their commitment to the greater good of humanity.
- **Structure**: E1 is organized into small, independent cells, each with its own mission focus and operational autonomy. The identities of E1's leadership remain unknown, even to many within the organization, adding an extra layer of security. Communication is handled through encrypted channels and anonymous contacts, ensuring that no single agent or cell knows the full extent of E1's operations.
- **Ethics**: While E1's methods are often controversial, the organization views them as necessary evils in the pursuit of a greater good. E1 operatives are expected to prioritize the mission above personal morality, understanding that their actions are part of a larger struggle for humanity's survival and autonomy. In the complex and dangerous world of galactic politics, E1 is a shadowy force working tirelessly to ensure that Earth remains more than just a minor vassal state, striving to secure a future where humanity is strong, respected, and self-reliant.
