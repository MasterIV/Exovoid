There once has been race more advanced than any other in the galaxy: they are usually referred to as the Elders.
The Elders have vanished from the galaxy, even though their technology is much more advanced than any species currently in existence.
Only some remnants of the elders can be found in the galaxy, the most prominent of them is a wormhole network that spans the galaxy.
There are occasional shifts in the wormhole network, which is one of reasons that earth became exposed to the galactic empire.
Most elder ruins nowadays only contain rubble and broken artifacts, and working elder tech is well guarded treasure.

#### Weapons and Sentinels

When elder technology was used in war, giant elder killing machines appeared and erased all life within 50 light years.
These machines are often referred to as sentinels and prevent species from using elder weapons in war.
Both sides being in possession of at least some of these weapons lead to a stalemate with mutually assured destruction.
