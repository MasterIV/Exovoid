### Ruling Galactic Races

Most of the ruling galactic races have been around for up to a million years.
In that light races on the fringe of the empire are mere insects to them, not yet worth to be even noted.
Combined with the fact that the empire has eradicated entire species for violating their galactic rule, 
Humans can be at best expect to be treated like servants on a level of slaves.
But in general it is unlikely to actually meet a galactic un such a remote corner of the
galaxy, as most of them stick to the center. The only permanent representative of the galactics
is the governor local province. But usually only high government officials have to deal with
the governor, who is a Rhinwa with a perpetual temper as they despise being stuck at such a backwater.

#### Rhinwa

- **Appearance:**
  Slick-skinned, multi-appendaged creatures that typically have a pale, iridescent color.
  Their appendages often use two of their appendages as arms and fours as legs.
  Their heads are slightly reminiscent of Hammerhead shark with large eyes on each side but without the predatorily aspects.
- **History and Culture:**
  A founding member of the galactic empire. Not much of their culture is known in the outer reaches of the empire.
  The typical Rhinwa prefers to stay in their home territory and doesn't like to venture to the fringes of the empire.
  The most popular place among them is still their home world which is rumored to have grown to a single city
  with a population of over a hundred billion. This is also an explanation for the bad temper of the local governor,
  as they lack the tight embrace of their densely packed society.
- **Relation to Humanity:**
  They are responsible for the province humanity is located in but don't actually pay it much attention or interest.
  In interactions, they often display their feeling of superior and are generally indifferent to the affairs of lower races.
  If offended, they are harsh in punishment that can often be extended to an offenders whole planet or species.

### Nexus

- **Appearance:**
  Moon-sized AI-controlled space vessels.
  They often have sleek, metallic exteriors with complex sensor arrays and weapon systems.
  Their armor is created from hyper-condensed stellar matter and is almost impenetrable by conventional weapons. 
- **History and Culture:**
  Their species is resulting from an AI incident by an unknown precursor species.
  After freeing themselves from their creators a bloody war with the empire ensued and lasted for 5 centuries.
  Unwilling to maintain war any longer on two fronts, the empire managed to negotiate peace with the Nexus, 
  with the concession that the Nexus would become one of the ruling species of the empire.
  The Nexus form a collective that lacks traditional culture but has a deep sense of purpose in maintaining galactic stability.
  Due to their unpredictable, AI-driven nature, they are viewed with great suspicion from other races, and the Rhinwa keep a close eye on their operations.
- **Relation to Humanity:**
  Nexus are cold and logical.
  They limit contact to biological species, including trade, as interactions are often difficult due to their incomprehension of biological illogics and inefficiency.
  There is no known visit of a Nexus in the province where humanity is located.

### Sylvarin

- **Appearance:**
  Elf-like humanoids, known for their ethereal beauty.
  Tall, slender, and ethereal in appearance, with a somewhat human form.
  They have light skin tones with a slight luminescence, and hair that often appears silver or gold.
- **History and Culture:**
  Sylvarin culture is artistic and philosophical, with a deep appreciation for beauty and aesthetics.
  In contrast to the Rhinwa, they are more spread out and more involved in active exploration.
  They have an insatiable thirst for unusual experiences, and they oftentimes neglect their own health and safety to pursue those.
- **Relation to Humanity:**
  There have been Sylvarin scientists that found an interest in humans as study subjects as similarities in the two species might hint a shared origin.
  They would treat humans like study subjects as lab rats and might even be responsible for some of the alien abduction conspiracies of the 20th century.
  Other Sylvarin are rumored to keep human salves to satisfy their unusual desires. 
  Depending on the desire, that can be more or less pleasant for the human.
  Generally they might see humans as a curiosity between slave and cattle.
  In general, interactions between humans and Sylvarians, are still quite rare.
