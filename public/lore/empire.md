The Galactic Empire is a vast and powerful interstellar union, 
spanning across the Sagittarius and Perseus arms of the Milky Way galaxy. 
The Empire is characterized by its hierarchical structure, 
where the core species, often referred to as the "Galactics" 
hold dominion over numerous vassal races, including humanity.
Its vast expanse, diverse species, and advanced technology make it a formidable force in the galaxy,
yet it is not without its challenges.
But despite these challenges, the empire has been around for over half a million years.

#### Founding and Expansion

The Empire was founded millennia ago by several core species located near the galactic center. 
These species, driven by a desire for stability, security, and resource control, formed a coalition that gradually expanded outward. 
Through a combination of diplomacy, trade, and military might, the Empire extended its influence across two major arms of the galaxy.

#### Structure and Governance

**Central Authority:**
At the heart of the Empire is a council of the most advanced and influential species, often called the "Galactics". 
These species are responsible for making high-level decisions, creating laws, and maintaining order within the Empire. 
The Empire currently lacks a single Emperor, as the ruling factions have yet to agree on a successor, 
resulting in a delicate balance of power among the council members.

**Vassal Races:**
There are countless vassal races that occupy the outer regions of the Empire. 
While they enjoy a degree of autonomy, their primary role is to support the Empire's interests, 
whether through providing resources, military assistance, or specialized skills.
Vassal races must adhere to the Empire's laws and avoid provoking the Galactics, 
who can impose severe punishments for insubordination.

**Galactic Rules and Regulations:**

The Empire enforces several key rules to maintain stability:

- **Prohibition of Planetary Destruction:** 
  The use of weapons capable of rendering planets uninhabitable is strictly forbidden.
  This usually makes the use of biological, chemical and some nuclear weapons outlawed.
- **Mandatory Military Support:** 
  Vassal races are required to assist in defending the Empire and its interests, 
  including participation in military conflicts when drafted.
- **Artificial Intelligence Restrictions:** 
  Creation and deployment of AI systems are strictly regulated. 
  All AI must include hard-coded ethical and operational limitations to prevent incidents similar to the Nexus event.
  AI with self-improvement capabilities are banned unless directly controlled and monitored by Galactic authorities.
- **Galactic Credit Control:**
  All economic transactions involving significant sums of galactic credits must be registered with the Galactic Financial Authority.
  Currency manipulation, counterfeiting, or unauthorized large-scale trade agreements are punishable by severe sanctions.
- **Galactic Patent Law:**
  Species are prohibited from producing or distributing technology that has been patented 
  under galactic law without explicit permission of the patent holder.
- **Elder Weapon Ban:**
  Vassals are forbidden from possessing any Elder weapons or technologies that can be weaponized.

These are just a few examples as the actual imperial law might fill a small library and there are
entire species dedicated to study, interpretation and resolving disputes. 
But if in doubt, the Galactics have the last say.

#### Challenges and Conflicts

**Internal Strife:**
The lack of a central Emperor has led to political maneuvering and tension among the ruling factions. 
This power struggle creates an unstable environment, with different species vying for greater influence.
Even though they appear unified to the outside, there is constant tension between the ruling races.

**External Threats:**
The Hegemony, a rival faction led by the feline Mordrex, poses a constant threat. 
The cold war between the Empire and the Hegemony keeps both sides on high alert, 
with espionage, skirmishes, and proxy wars being common.

**Technological Disparity:**
The technological gap between the Galactics and vassal races can lead to friction. 
Vassal races, including humanity, often feel marginalized and struggle to assert their relevance within the Empire.
