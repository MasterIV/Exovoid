The Hegemony stands as a formidable rival to the Galactic Empire,
its influence spreading across vast regions of the galaxy.
Unlike the cooperative nature of the Empire, the Hegemony is marked by strict hierarchy, control,
and a culture of dominance enforced by its ruling species, the Mordrex.
This faction thrives on division and competition among its member species, maintaining control through fear and power.

#### History and Formation

**Origins and Expansion:**
The Hegemony was founded by the Mordrex,
a warlike feline race that emerged victorious from numerous interstellar conflicts.
Their ambition and martial prowess allowed them to subjugate neighboring species,
gradually building an empire based on conquest and domination.
Over time, the Hegemony expanded through both military might and strategic alliances,
absorbing diverse species under its control.

**Philosophy of Rule:**
The core philosophy of the Hegemony is that might makes right.
The Mordrex believe they are destined to rule the galaxy,
and they impose this belief on all species within their domain.
To prevent unity among their subjugated races,
the Mordrex foster an atmosphere of mistrust and rivalry,
ensuring that no single species or coalition can challenge their authority.

#### Structure and Governance

**Central Authority:**
The Hegemony is ruled by the Mordrex High Command,
a council of elite Mordrex leaders who make all major decisions.
This ruling body enforces strict policies to maintain control and suppress dissent.
The Mordrex High Command is known for its ruthless efficiency and intolerance for rebellion.

**Client Races:**
Client races within the Hegemony have little autonomy and are often pitted against one another to keep them weak and divided.
The conditions for these races are harsh, with severe punishments for failing to obey their masters.

**Military Dominance:**
The Hegemony maintains a vast and highly disciplined military force.
Each client race is equally required to maintain significant forces,
with the Mordrex commanding all major military operations.
The Hegemony’s military is known for its brutal tactics and willingness to sacrifice client species in pursuit of victory.

#### Notable Species

**Ruling Species:**

- **Mordrex:** A feline warrior race, the Mordrex are the undisputed rulers of the Hegemony.
  They are characterized by their physical prowess, tactical genius, and unyielding belief in their right to rule.
  The Mordrex see themselves as the pinnacle of evolution and are intolerant of any challenge to their supremacy.

**Client Races:**

- **K’thari:** An avian race of proud and free-spirited bird people.
  Despite their pride, they were forced into the Hegemony due to their home world's strategic location.
  The K’thari are known for their agility and keen eyesight, making them excellent scouts and pilots.
- **Sarithan:** A subterranean reptilian race dominated by a warrior caste.
  They have a surprising depth of culture, especially in the arts, with a particular affinity for opera.
  The Sarithan serve as shock troops and frontline soldiers in the Hegemony’s military.
- **Zargoth:** A cybernetic race that despises their organic roots, viewing organic life as inferior.
  The Zargoth excel in technology and cyber warfare, often overseeing the Hegemony's technological and cybernetic infrastructure.

#### Culture and Society

**Survival of the Fittest:**
Life within the Hegemony is harsh and competitive.
The ruling Mordrex enforce a culture of survival of the fittest, where only the strong and cunning can thrive.
This philosophy permeates every aspect of life, from politics to daily interactions, fostering an environment of constant vigilance and rivalry.

**Social Hierarchy:**
The social structure is rigid, with the Mordrex at the top, followed by a hierarchy of client races based on their usefulness and loyalty.
Rebellion is met with swift and brutal suppression, ensuring that the Mordrex retain absolute control.
Client races must navigate a complex web of alliances and enmities to survive.

#### Relation to the Empire

As the existence of the Empire opposes the supreme rule over the galaxy by the Mordrex,
the natural consequence can only be war.
For decades both faction have engaged in a fierce war that has cost trillions of lives.
This changed when the war escalated to a point where both sides started using old Elder weaponry.
Ancient Machines called Sentinels appeared and scoured everything within 50 light years from life.
After this incident the war with the empire turned cold.
The Mordex and Galactics refrained from engaging directly and instead have their
vassals and clients fight in a proxy war.
There are usually minor gains and losses but the border between the empire and hegemony
effectively hasn't changed in the past centuries.
Nowadays, the war is at a stalemate with regular skirmishes occurring.
