#### Categorization

People usually tend to categorize technology into various tiers. These are the most commonly used ones:

- **Archaic:** Civilisations that have not yet reached industrialisation and computing basics.
- **Pre-Warp:** Even though FTL travel isn't actually using Warp-Drives, civilisations that are not capable of FTL flight are typically referred to as pre-warp.
  This might be due to the fact that pre-ftl simply doesn't sound as catchy.
- **Interstellar:** Most species humanity has been in contact with fall undert his category, as these civilisations are capable of interstellar travel.
  At this point, development is slightly distorted as the basic technology for interstellar travel is one of the few that is regularly shared with others.
  Most species keep a tight lid on their technology but FTL is the base for galactic commerce and interaction and therefore the exception.
  Within this category the actual technologies a species discovered differ widely.
  It depends what a race puts their focus on and what the culture and science evolve around.
  This can be warfare, exploration, industry, genetic advancements or whatever one can imagine.
- **Advanced:** These civilisations have mastered the more advanced concepts of science not only allowing them to develop superior weapons, but also a lot of other useful technologies that make space exploration easier.
  This includes the mastery over gravity, inertia and energy fields.
  These civilisations are leading in the fields of genetic engineering and computer systems, often capable of merging the two seamlessly.
  In contrast to previous tiers, there is no hard line and the difference between Interstellar and Advanced civilisations is more of a scale than a binary category.
- **Super Advanced:** So far, only the elders are known to fall into this category: a civilisation so advanced that they could shape the galaxy as they please.

#### Intergalactic Travel Technologies

**1. Wormhole Network:**
The most advanced and efficient method of intergalactic travel, created by the mysterious Elder race.
This network consists of stable wormholes connecting distant points in the galaxy, allowing instantaneous travel between them.
Every couple of centuries there have been shifts in the network, with some wormholes disappearing and others emerging.
The stable wormholes within the network emerge in regular intervals at specific points.
The emergence points of a specific wormhole slightly vary within a region.
Transition through a wormhole is nearly instant.

**2. Jump Drive:**
Besides the elder wormhole network, ships are typically equipped with jump drives.
These function similar to the network, also creating wormholes, but on a much smaller scale.
These drives charge up jump coils which then create a tiny wormhole, just large enough to fit the ship that initiated it.
Ships can only bridge a couple of light years at once, while elder wormholes sometimes span across half the galaxy.
Depending on how depleted a drive has gotten, it requires time to recharge between jumps.
It is possible to do multiple short jumps only depleting the capacitors partly ore a big one using the entire charge.
The formation of stable jump wormholes is impeded by gravity wells or artificially created dampening fields.
Jump wormholes are the only technology commonly possessed that exceeds the speed of light.
Only the elders were capable of other methods that exceeded light speed.

**3. Regular Propulsion:**
Most pre-warp and early interstellar civilisations use propulsion based on chemical reactions.
This creates exhaust that is ejected from the craft and creates thrust.
A more advanced form are ION drives, though they still create exhaust in the form of ionized gas.
The exhaust makes most of these vessels easy to spot with the appropriate scanning equipment.
Harder to detect are reactionless drives that utilize the force of gravity to propel ships.
However, such technology is mostly seen within advanced civilizations.
Most species manage to develop artificial gravity for ships before they manage to reach advanced methods for propulsion.
This is also usually preceded with the development of inertia dampening technology which allows ships to perform fast speed and acceleration maneuvers without turning organic crew into meat paste.

#### Communication and Surveillance

Only the elders ar rumored to have possessed communication technology that was not limited to the speed of light.
All other species in the galaxy are dependent on a network of relay stations and small courier ships with jump drive distributing data between them.
These courier ships are usually automated drones that self-destruct if they detect a risk of being captured.
The relay stations are equipped with the highest level of cybersecurity and usually also self-destruct when breached.

#### Weapons and Defense Technologies

Weapons have a wide range.
Low technology races like humans are mostly limited to kinetic weapons like cannons and rail guns.
More advanced races also make heavy use of various energy-based weapons.
This ranges from lasers and masers to more exotic forms like disruptors, which fires intense bolts of energy phased in such a way as to disrupt the molecular cohesion of the target.
When it comes to the elders there are no limits, other than your imagination.
They were rumored to be capable of rending space-time itself, tearing vessels apart from the inside or even destroying entire stars.
But these weapons have been lost in time and if they ever surface, the sentinels make their use highly unpractical.
